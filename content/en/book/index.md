It's a book about software development for people that donâ€™t have a background in computer science but want to know more about this world. Are you not interested in becoming a developer? No problem! This book is still for you:

> *We can only build software for everyone if everyone is involved in the construction of software. Anything besides that is utterly flawed. The only way we can guarantee we have technology that actually changes the world is if we include everyone in the conversation. And if your life will more and more be guided by software products, why not be part of this change?*


It is now vailable in [Amazon UK](https://amzn.to/3TjQjv3), [Amazon US](https://amzn.to/3hX0OYi ) and many others! If you prefer, you can buy directly from the [publisher's website](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-8969-3)
