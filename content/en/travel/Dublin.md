## City Center

- Start on [Trinity University](https://g.page/TheBookofKells?share) and if you have time go in and see the Old Library and Books of Keels

- Have a walk on [St Stephen's Green park](https://goo.gl/maps/G9LXPrvcjqmnjrcP9)
    - This park was the place where there was a major fight against english invaders in 1916. You can find a ton of history there, as this is considered the beginning of Irish independence

## Coastal Villages

Near Dublin you will find a lot of small coastal towns that are super nice. All of the villages I recommend have access by the Dart (local train). I would recommend doing only 1 of them per day, 2 if they are super close (like maybe Bray and Greystones).  

On Sundays the dart has less trains than usual and villages like Greystones and Malahide have the least frequent lines.

You have some options:

- Dun Laoghaire (it's pronounced Dun-Liry) is a nice little village on the south. There are a couple of restaurant, a pier and a nice coastal area.
    - You can walk until [Forty foot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hZe6rePRJxxhWX7y6), a nice swimming spot (for those who like cold waters)
    - You can see the a [Napolean tower that is a museum for James Joyce](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hZe6rePRJxxhWX7y6)
    - Nice restaurants:
        - Belli Dentro - cozy Italian place
        - La Dolce Italia - cozy Italian place
        - Shoe lane - great coffee!
        - Bibi's - I love their turkish eggs
        - Nunki - great chinese
    - On Sundays you have a people's market full of tasty food! 
    - If you have time you can go to Dalkey and have some beers under a 13th century tower or enjoy one of the many restaurants in the cozy little village. It's one of the richiest places in Dublin
- Bray is a costal village. There's a ton of restaurants and is very busy on weekends.
    - If the weather is good go to the walk by the cliffs from Bray to Greystones (~10km). In this walk, you will follow the train line and there's several spots for photos
    - You can either go around the Cliffs or up to the Bray Head where you can see some amazing views
    - If you go to Bray, we love Dockyard no 8 for brunches!
    - You can grab a taxi and visit the [Powerscourt House & Gardens](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cR42fgyTapSLJ9cM9) for a nice day out and even do a small hiking to its waterfall
- Malahide is a nice little village in the opposite direction of Bray.
    - [It has an amazing 13th castle fully preserved and nice gardens](https://goo.gl/maps/iTFBCcbZRLtedvhK9)
    - If you go west there's a [lovely walking path](https://goo.gl/maps/yMF66f5S3mcPunRw9) between Malahide and [Pormarnock beach](https://goo.gl/maps/HgHniqhDpupq9Pgr5) that is worth the walk!
    - Nice restaurants:
        - Deja vu is a good place for brunch!
        - Gino's has an amazing ice-cream, my favourite
- Howth is another coastal village with a great Irish vibe. There is a beautiful view, some ruins of castles and tons of restaurants.
    - If you are up for the challenge there is a 10km walk on the cliffs around it!
    - The sunset is amazing from the pier
    - If the weather is good you can take a boat and go to a small island that has a beach
    - [O'Connels](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7PAuPUGKmfvq2H8E9) have TVs with sports and nice coquetels

## Other places near Dublin or not so easy to go

- [National Botanic Gardens](https://maps.app.goo.gl/R7CB2k6gbfK1YW3H9) is a nice place to spend a lazy afternoon
- [Johnny Fox's Pub](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2zZCrQNhSveMgXQJ6) has a nice ambiance, live music and dancing and tasty food
- [Glendalough](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mLXmEarRB1kbEdxE7) has some nice hikings you can go
- [Powerscourt House & Gardens](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cR42fgyTapSLJ9cM9) for a nice day out and even do a small hiking to its waterfall

## Where to go

### If you only have a day…

Visit the city centre, as it will give you more options and a bigger-city vibe

### If you have 2 days…

Take 1 day for the city centre and one day in a costal village. I would recommend Dun Laoghaire if it's on a weekend day as I love the music and vibe (I lived there for 3 years)

### If you have 3 days…

Consider also going to either Malahide or Howth! Go to Howth if you have energy for some cliff walk.

### If you have more than 3 days…

Think about going to the countryside. There is a ton of beautiful landscapes like the Cliffs of Moher that you can go on a single day trip (like [this one](https://www.paddywagontours.com/)). I looove the Irish countryside.

## Some tips

- Butler's chocolate is delicious! I particularly like the ones with Gin or Irish cream
- Irish people are incredibly friendly and welcoming. Make sure you experience the local culture.
- Dublin is very walkable. Bring comfy shoes and a rain jacket to make sure you can enjoy most of the city! 
- There isn't Uber but Uber will work just fine. It will just call you a taxi!
- I don't ever remember not using credit card/Apple Pay for everything. I don't remember last time I had cash on me!
- Traffic can get crazy. If you are going to the airport during peak hours, make sure to leave enough time for it
- You can buy a public transport card for 5 euro. Then you just add money and start using it. You will pay --at most-- 2 euro per 90 min of public transportation. If you used it once, you can use any public transportation (LUAS, Bus, Train) for 90 mins with no extra charge. In LUAS and Train make sureyou tap twice always! 
- All National Museums are free of charge, so if you like Viking history I recommend going to the [Archaeology](https://goo.gl/maps/e1WK6wKqK8bN84J8A) museum
