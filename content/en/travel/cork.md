**Caveat**: we did all this in a small break from the lockdown, so we didn't go to closed spaces and a lot of things were still in recovery. Things may differ. We also did everything with public transportation, so we were limited in the options we had for the trip.

## Day 1 - Dublin to Cork and Cork City

We got a train from Dublin to Cork City leaving on the Dublin Heuston Station. You can get the tickets [here](https://www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/). The train ride was espectacular but it is quite long. We spent a lazy day in Cork, mainly walking around the town. The town is small and very walkable. It has a buzy city centre will all the big stores (H&M, Zara, etc)

## Day 2 - Kinsale

From Cork we got [a bus](https://www.buseireann.ie/routes-and-timetables/226) to [Kinsale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsale), the town full of coloured houses. The bus leave from the city main bus station and it is quite easy to find, not too far from the train station. It's about an hour away from Cork City. 

The town is really nice, we walked around, checked the stores and enjoyed our day. There are a bunch of coffee shops, gelato places and small stores to spend the day. 

## Day 3  - Cobh

From the same train station you arrive in Cork City and you can get the DART (urban train) to Cobh. Cobh was the last port the Titanic stopped before leaving for America, so there is a museum you can go.

There is a famous street with the coloured houses and church in the background. The church is totally worth a visit! It is majestic! I did not expect it to be so cute. 

## Day 4 - Blarney Castle and way back

From Cork you can take a city bus to go to [Blarney Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blarney_Castle) and parks. This is absolutely a must-see. There's a medieval castle and a 18th century mansion in the grounds, as well as a beautiful forest, gardens and much more. The forest has a vibe that you could go back in time in it. 

Blarney Castle has a stone that it is known for supposedly give you great oratory if you kiss it. But to do so you need to be on your back over a big, BIG open space. There are two guys to help you do it, but my senses told me I should avoid it. 

## Other things around…

- [Fota Wildlife Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BXFa1x6YaWdKWodx8) is supposed to be a pretty good experience, especially with kids
- I love the history behind the sculpture [Kindred Spirits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindred_Spirits_(sculpture)). Even if you don't go there, you should know it too

## Where we went to eat

- We went to [Franciscan Well Brewery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/z9BeakTBZ6Mk4Ly76) and weren't disappointed. They have an amazing selection of beers and delicious pizza. The pub has a young and electric vibe that is pretty nice.
- We went to [Gallagher's](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mAAnvg9ZBACGZFJ4A) twice for their seafood pie. Absolutely unbelievable.
