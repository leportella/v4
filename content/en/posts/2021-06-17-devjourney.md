 The summary:

> _Leticia took us from her job in oceanography to her current software engineering role at Stripe. She described how Python changed her life, or to be more accurate, how the Brasilian Python community changed her life. We talked about learning, sharing, writing, and knowing yourself. We talked about mentorship and helping others. What a story!_
