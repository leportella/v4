And suddendly... I wrote a book. Well, it may be suddenly to you, dear reader, that didn't know I was even doing this. But definitely not suddenly to me. This was a really long process, and so long I am only now (almost one year after I delivered the manuscript) writing a blog post about it. 

I wanted to share my experience for a long long time. Even before I finished the book I had ideas of what I wanted to write about this experience. But as you may guess by the time it took me to actually sit down and write this, you can imagine that things didn't go acording to plan (as I guess they never do).

I had the dream of writing a book since I can remember. I wanted to be writer before I knew how to write good sentences. It was the only dream I had that never changed. I just figured it was too difficult to be acomplished. What do *I* have to talk about? 

When I was younger I gave it a go to a couple of fiction stories. Of course, being a kid raised on the Harry Potter world, I created a Potter-esc kind of story. As I grew I had this idea for a really sad story. Then I tried to write and it just *felt* wrong. My writing style was not developed enough and the story was way too sad for my taste. 

When I started this blog, I was partially satisfying my need for being a writing. As the years went by and the number of posts started to grow, I was satisfied. That was close enough to being a writer. I guess I can count it as a "book".

## The idea

In 2019 I met this person that was moving from a traditional company to a big tech and she was struggling. We were having coffee and she was quite scared. I felt so bad for her. I wanted to help her *so bad*. But I tried to go over my brain to see what kind of content I could send to her, and found nothing. She was not a developer. She didn't want to be one. Then it clicked: *there is nothing for her*. Which means that there's an opportunity for me. I write. Why couldn't I write *for her*?

So I had this idea: what if I wrote a technical book for someone that don't want to be a developer. Was that even feasible? Would that even make sense? Would anyone even buy it? I did not know. I thought that there was an audience. After all, more and more companies are investing in technology and more and more people are having their lifes guided by software. It made sense. But still... it felt a bit too far away.

I decided not to jump into it right away. I had just moved to Dublin, started my first job here, working full-time in English on an area I was deeply unexperienced. I was exhausted all the time and I simply... couldn't. So I just let it marinate in my brain.

## The beginning

Then, it was march 2020 everything changed. Suddendly I was home *all the time*. I couldn't go to the gym or any of my social events. Suddenly, I had time. Well... guess I could try this.

One thing I want to make very, *very* clear to everyone is: I am very priviledged that I had **time**. I didn't have a kid to take care of, nor a dog. My mental health state --considering everything-- was good and I had a great house and an amazing and supportive partner. Also, thankfully, my loved ones were taking care of themselves and no one needed me to take care of them. I had the perfect conditions to, at least, *try* to do something.

I figured I could maybe try to create some blog posts that aimed to do something similar. I wrote [What does it mean to test software](https://leportella.com/my-handbook-i/)... and it flopped. Nobody really read it. In fact, in the past year it only received 8 views (my most accessed post had over 4.5 thousand). However, I realized that the audience I had in mind wouldn't access my blog. Let alone search for a blog post like this. So maybe, just *maybe* I shouldn't take this too seriously. Resilence checkpoint ðŸ˜¬.

At this point I was a bit all over the place. I am lucky enought that I have a dear friend and mentor, Luciano Ramalho who wrote [Fluent Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/) a best seller book (this is a masterpiece. If you want to know Python, do buy the book). He kindly gave me his time and we talked about my early ideas. He gave me some wonderful insights, but 4 years after (almost) there were two that stick above all others. 

The first was that I should forget table of contents and I should do a mental map. Lay out topics I wanted to talk about and see what patterns emerge. The chapter will flow more naturally from there. That was genious! I was so stuck on the idea of needing to have a table of contents, that it was doing more harm than good. Once I started my mental map things started following into place.

George R.R. Martin, one of my favorite writers, [says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBOafgYJABA) that there are two types of writers: the architect and the gardener. Th architect is that writer that makes a plan and executes on it. It has a clear, straightline, and they follow it. The gardener (that's how George considers himself) let's the story grow. He takes the time to see where the story wants to go and is ok of changing the plan if the tree is growing elsewhere. I loved this idea and I felt this worked better for me. To let my writing go where it wanted to be, even if it was not where I imagined it would go first.

From the mental map I created a sort of path for me to follow, but as time went by it changed. A lot. I changed chapters orders, included things, remove others. I let my story grow as it liked.    

The second advice Luciano gave me was:

> *Consider this book as an MVP. Leave space for a second edition. You don't have to add everything on this book.* Luciano Ramalho

You have *no idea* how freeing this was. This advice, this 30s advice saved me thousands of hours of unnecessary work. As someone that wanted to help people, I wanted a book with **everything**. However, leaving space for the book to grow allowed me to focus on what was the minimum I needed to add to help people. That are topics I said I would add a chapter that I can easily see them becoming a whole book on it's own now. 

## The proof of concept

After the blog post I decided to start fresh
