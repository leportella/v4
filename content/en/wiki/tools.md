## Notes

I like the bear.app for daily diaries in my work but I use notion.so to everything else!
  
  
## Design

I use [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) for all my podcasts designs and my resumee!

## Fluxograms

[Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/) is my go-to tool for this. It is very expensive but it allows you 4 free boards (and I use them well)!

## Mental maps

[Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/) is my go-to tool for this. It is very expensive but it allows you 4 free boards (and I use them well)!


## Whiteboard colaboration

[Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/) can be good but quite confusing. I am currently trying [Miro](https://miro.com/)
