## Design

I use [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) for all my podcasts designs and my resumee!

## Fluxograms

[Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/) is my go-to tool for this. It is very expensive but it allows you 4 free boards (and I use them well)!

## Mental maps

[Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/) is my go-to tool for this. It is very expensive but it allows you 4 free boards (and I use them well)!

## Notes

I like the [bear.app](http://bear.app/) for daily diaries in my work. It is pretty cheap if you want multi-platform use (15 euro/year)! 

I use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for everything else! Notion is free for single use
  

## Whiteboard colaboration

[Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/) can be good but quite confusing. I am currently trying [Miro](https://miro.com/)
