## Microphone

I use a [Blue Yeti](https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/yeti/) microphone for recording my podcast.


## Keyboard

I use a [Keychron K2 Wireless](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) keyboard. They can pair with up to 3 devices at once, which was a good feature.
I don't like clicky keyboard so I am using the Red switch option, which also makes the keyboard more thin and other models.
