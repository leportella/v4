-  When I got pregnancy, my instagram/feed went insane. Don't freak out <3 Block words like pregnancy and disease to make sure you are not flooded with bad content.
    - Being a mom is amazing. A lot of people will tell you your life is over but it is not. Make sure you follow the right people
- I love [Dr Mona](https://www.instagram.com/pedsdoctalk?igsh=MTRyYm8xYzl5OWllMg==). She’s absolutely one of the best pediatricians out there
- [Dr Lauren](https://www.instagram.com/drlaurenhughes?igsh=MTJndzFocWljMTAwZw==) is so funny and good. Also a must watch on how to take care of babies
- [Dr Shilpa](https://www.instagram.com/pedsbraindoc?igsh=Y3NoNGpuYzU2aHVm) is more focused on neural development but also I love her as well
- [dr Fabiano](https://www.instagram.com/dr.fabianotebas?igsh=MWk1djdibDVsZHNwMA==) is a Brazilian pediatric doctor. He help me in the first few months but I started to think he was too much later. So check for yourself
