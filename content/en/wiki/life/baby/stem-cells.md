We asked the midwife in our classes and the service is available in Ireland but not as common. The midwife seemed particularly not pro doing this. She said it would be done by private companies and the prices would be around 3000 euro. 

Decided to study to see if it is a good thing. There’s  a really good article from the New York Times from July 2024 about the topic: [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/health/cord-blood-storage-contamination.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/health/cord-blood-storage-contamination.html)

TLDR: it costs a lot and most samples are either too small and/or contaminated. Recent technology allows us to retrieve stem cells from adults, so most institutions in the US don’t even accept this kind of cells.
