- [Pregnancy for men](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pregnancy-Men-expectant-guide-months/dp/190541062X) —> most books focus on mom, this one is for dads
- Save our sleep by Tizzy Hall and When your child is sick by Prof Alf Nicholson —> both recommended by my GP
    - When your child is sick became super useful when she was a bit older. There’s a clear list of red alerts for each scenario that is helpful
- 60 dias de neblina —> book in portuguese about baby blues. I personally didn't like it, thought it was too dramatic and without a clear train of thought but a lot of friends recommended and loved it
- What to expect the first year —> tons of tips for what can happen after the birth. I’m using it a lot
- The wonder weeks —> they explain the growth spurs, when to expect them and what the baby will learn in each one. They also have an app but it is more expensive then buying the book
