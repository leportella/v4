[This was my baby shopping list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QaJPa_cjD96G2b9oFRPCPNp3r2r5eGPkGss6RR97LIM/edit?usp=sharing)

- I focused on the bare bare minimum because things can go insane
- If in Ireland, do buy things in advance. Our crib delivery date was 2 months away and still they said it could take an extra month. The buggy we got on [babydocshop.ie](http://babydocshop.ie) and the estimates is 4-5 weeks to delivery
- I don't recommend buying a lot of baby clothes. Most people I know wanted to give me clothes and we ended up with waaaay more than I expected
- If you do buy clothes, most people recommended ziper onesies because changing diapers in the middle of the night and trying to find buttons is painful
    - The most recommended brand they gave me was Carters
    - Particularly, I hated the zipped clothes because they made a lump that would be in baby's face
