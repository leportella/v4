## Clothes

 Penneys and Dunnes have great cotton basic clothes but they have a size small
- Next has the best and cutest outfits but they are more expensive. M&S is also good. I like their clothes
- Search for donation groups in your area. So many good toys I got from my neighbours
    - There’s a free cycle group in the north of Dublin that is fantastic
- My baby hated swaddle as much as possible. The only thing that worked was the Love to Dream swaddle with hands up. Omg this was life changing. If your baby hates the regular swaddle, try this one

## [Ireland] Urgent care

- If it’s out of hours and you feel like baby is unwell but not sure, you can call Ddoc services. We used them twice in the first year and they were fast and reliable
    - You call and tell what is going on. A nurse will call you back and assess your case. If she think it is the case, you will get an appointment with a doctor in the next couple of hours. We went to Swords and Blanchardstown and both were very on time.
- If something is more urgent, there are children hospitals all around. In the north side I think the closest is [Temple Street](https://www.childrenshealthireland.ie/your-hospital-visit/our-locations/temple/)
- The book “When your child is sick” is really helpful in knowing when you need to ask for help

## Baby development

- I went to the Baby Sensory classes and they are a must-go. Absolutely amazing, and they are for all ages up to 13 months.
- I tried swimming by Water Babies and Turtle Tots. I much more preferred the first, very focused in getting the kid secure in the water. The second is not bad, but I thought it was too slow (and the place I went the water was waaaaay too cold)
