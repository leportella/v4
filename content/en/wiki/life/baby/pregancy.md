## As soon as you discover...

The biggest recommendations are:

- Do pelvic physiotherapy. I went to [Her Physio](https://herphysio.ie/) as soon as could. She is a Brazilian who lives in Ireland for 12 years and I couldn't recommend her enough. If you speak PT, her online content is GOLD
    - She books early. Book 2-3 sessions in advance and cancel if you don't like it
    - Each session is 160 euro, Laya covers 40 euro. I do 1 per month, and 2 in the last month before due date
        - The partner is recommended to go in one of the last sessions so they can learn and help on the day!
    - Even if you want to go through a C-Section, your body will change a lot, so you can be prepared
    - I was so so so scary of the birth, she changed my life, really.
- Find a GP that is free during pregnancy and afterwards. Everything is free for children until they are 8 years old in Ireland, so having a doctor that is free is a must. Also one near your house. You don’t want to travel with a feverish baby if you need

## [Ireland] Public vs Semi Private vs Private

We decided to go Public. Basically because the semi-private and private you need to pay for the doctors and you are responsible for all costs at delivery (epidural, C-section, etc). The insurance do cover most of it but we decided it was not worth the risk vs benefit. 

The big pros to go with semi-private or private are: 

- you are seen by doctors not midwifes
- in private you are always seen by the same doctor, in semi private they have a group of doctors to see you
- you can get more isolated rooms after delivery (public you are with up to 5 other women)
- I think you get more ultrasounds

Recommend going on reddit and reading posts. After I read a post about a really complicated pregnancy that was handled well on the public system, decided to make my taxes worth it. Haven't regretted it (32 weeks and counting).

In the public care I have seen an obstetrician at every appointment. It’s always a different one, but I always see them 

At some point I asked about getting diagnosed for gestational diabetes and they did do the exam. I don’t think they would do it otherwise, but I was very insistent because 2 friends were diagnosed 

**[National Maternity Hall]** After delivery, you can only have a visitor with you on the room from 8am to 9pm. I sent an email to see if my husband could sleep there if we go private but they said no, hospital policy.  So be aware that if you stay multiple nights, you will be “alone” during the night. This was the exact words:

- *No, your husband is not permitted to stay overnight, the normal hospital rules apply.*

- This [shapewear](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/B07MBFZF55?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title) helped me SO MUCH when the weight of the belly was too much
- [Pregnancy pillow](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wndys-Dream-Pregnancy-Maternity-Pregnant/dp/B08X128X3T) was a gift and I loved it
- [These shoes](https://www.skechers.ie/skechers-slip-ins-ultra-flex-3.0---brilliant/149710_WHT.html) saved my life. My back started hurting a lot and you dont need to tie your shoes

## Useful stores

- [Ireland] There's a Kids H&M on the top floor of Dundrum shopping centre that sells maternity clothes. Not a lot of options but I liked it more than the “maternity shops” I checked personally
- [Seraphine](https://www.seraphine.com/) is the store I bought the majority of clothes
