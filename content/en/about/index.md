Hey there! Welcome!

I'm glad that you found my space in this vast internet and want to know a bit more about me. 


Well, [I am an oceanographer that discovered to be passionate about programming](http://leportella.com/from-oceanographer-to-programmer.html) 
and decided to changed careers. Since then, I've been writing blog posts about technical stuff, my career evolution and life in general. 
I really hope you enjoy it and feel free to leave a comment or write to me if any of the texts were useful to you. 
Sometimes I lack imagination on posts I could write and receiving messages always makes me come back to the computer!

I'm an open-source enthusiast and a living proof of the community's power and of what it can do for a person. 
The Python community, in particular, helped me so much over the years that I always try to give back everytime I can. 

I am crazy about books and, in particular, the Chronicles of Ice and Fire and all their theories. I have tons of books that I love but some of my favorites are:

* Sh√≥gun - James Clavell
* The Godfather - Mario Puzo
* Pillars of Earth - Ken follet
* The physician - Noah Gordon
* The hunger games - Suzanne Collins 


In 2017, I started a brazilian podcast specifically for data science called [Pizza de Dados](http://pizzadedados.com), 
which is a joke with Pizza and the brazilian word for data (and dice!). Pizza de Dados
is the first and biggest podcast of data science in Brazil and has an important role on bringing quality content in portuguese. 
I am very proud of it. So, if you ask me about it... I'll probably go on and on about my baby <3.

It's been a crazy journey that I never saw coming! But now that's here, I am happy beyond I could ever imagine.
